SEARCH AND RESCUE DOGS
This project begins with a server-side database consisting of data collected from a nonprofit agency that operates 5 animal shelters around Austin, Texas. The database is imported into Mongodb and using Jupyter Notebook to write our python script, we will connect our script to run queries on the database through pymongo. Our python script will include methods to Create data that will be inserted into the database, Read data from the database, Update existing data, and Delete data.
The second phase of this project will include a client facing web application interface to access the database.
This project will be made open source for other similar organizations to implement.

Motivation
The motivation of this project is to identify the proper candidates for search and rescue training. Once these dogs are trained, they will go on to assist in locating and rescuing other animals or humans in life threatening conditions.
Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally: “To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.”

Installation
MongoDB
Pymongo
Jupyter Notebook

Usage
This project uses basic CRUD function to manipulate/navigate information throughout the animals database. This CRUD method will allow data to be added into the database and located efficiently and displayed from the database. The database will include user authentication to protect access to the database.

Tests
  
Using Jupyter Notebook, you are able to create a simple script query and run the script against the CRUD class to test functionality of the class and its methods. Simply %load ‘.py file location for CRUD class’, click cell and run cell and insert cell below. Then %load ‘.py file test script’, and run all cells. 
NOTE: you must have a instance of MongoDB started in a terminal before running the test in a new Notebook.

Roadmap/Features (Optional)
Provide an open issues list of proposed features (and known issues). If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README. What makes your project stand out?

Note: This section is optional for the purposes of this assignment. If you choose not to fill out this section, remove it from your final README file.
